📊 Olist E-Commerce Data Analytics (Python)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on end-to-end data analytics using the Olist E-Commerce dataset to understand business performance, customer order trends, and revenue patterns.

The analysis is performed entirely using Python, following a structured analytics workflow commonly used by data analysts in real-world projects. The goal is to convert raw e-commerce data into meaningful insights that can support business decision-making.

🧠 Business Problem

E-commerce businesses generate large volumes of transactional data but often struggle to:

Understand order and revenue trends over time

Identify seasonality and performance fluctuations

Track key business metrics consistently

Convert raw data into actionable insights

This project addresses these challenges by applying data analytics techniques to uncover trends, KPIs, and insights from historical order data.

🔄 Analytics Workflow Followed

This project follows a structured data analytics lifecycle, similar to industry practice:

Business understanding

Data collection & loading

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Data transformation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

KPI definition

Time-series trend analysis

Performance analysis

Insight generation

Reporting & documentation

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Converted date columns into proper datetime formats

Standardized numeric fields for analysis

Removed invalid or duplicate records where required

This step ensured the dataset was analysis-ready and reliable.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA to:

Understand order volume distribution

Identify revenue patterns

Detect anomalies and outliers

Analyze monthly and yearly trends

Visualizations were created to clearly communicate trends and variations in the data.

⏳ Time-Series Analysis

Analyzed order and revenue trends over time

Identified seasonality patterns in customer orders

Compared performance across different time periods

This helped in understanding how business performance changes month-over-month.

📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Defined and analyzed KPIs such as:

Total Orders

Total Revenue

Average Order Value

Monthly Growth Trends

KPIs were used to measure overall business health and performance.

💡 Key Insights

Order volumes show clear seasonal patterns

Revenue trends vary significantly across time periods

Certain months contribute disproportionately to total revenue

Data anomalies can strongly impact performance reporting if not cleaned properly

📊 Visualizations

Line charts for time-series trends

Bar charts for performance comparison

Distribution plots for understanding data spread
